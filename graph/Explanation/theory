Python lists can function as both a stack and a queue because they support both append and pop operations.
1)LIFO (Stack):
When using the pop() function on a list, it removes the last element, effectively simulating a stack's LIFO behavior (Last-In-First-Out).

2)FIFO (Queue):
When using the pop(0) function on a list, it removes the first element, effectively simulating a queue's FIFO behavior (First-In-First-Out).

#DefaultDictionary:
A defaultdict in Python is a container that works almost exactly like a regular dictionary,
but it has one difference: the value fields' data type is specified upon initialization.
 This means that if you try to access a key that doesn't exist in the defaultdict,
 it will automatically create a new entry with the default value instead of raising a KeyError.

# adjacency matrix :adjacency matrix is symmetric if adj_matrix[u][v] is equal to adj_matrix[v][u]
